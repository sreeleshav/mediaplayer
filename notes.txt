-technique to pass data from 





props drilling: sharing data through unnesssory/unwarnted components
---------------

we want  to send Add() to Videocard()
but the way is: Add>Home>Video>Videocard
the infoemation need only Videocard
but the information pass all the function this method is called coupling

coupling:is considered as the measure of involving of unnesssory components in a props drilling case

->React Redux:its conceept/technique defined for overcoming props drilling and passing data in a more efficent way

-redux consist of a global store concept which can contain states that can be accessed by any component in react app.
through this,a component can pass data through the global store state to other component without involving other components

Redux workflow
--------------------

To pass the information Add to Videocard

Add-->(dispatch)-->Action--> -->(payload)-->Global store (reducer) -->globalstore inside State ==> Videocard
